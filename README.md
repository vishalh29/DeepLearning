# Handwritten Digits Classification Using Neural Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits using neural networks. The project is built using TensorFlow and Keras and progresses through several models to demonstrate the impact of different neural network architectures on performance.

## Project Description

The notebook begins with a simple neural network model without hidden layers and progresses to more complex models including:
- A single-layer neural network
- A neural network with one hidden layer
- A neural network using a Flatten layer to simplify the input handling

Each model is evaluated on the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the step-by-step process of building and training the neural networks:

```bash
jupyter notebook digits_recognition_neural_network.ipynb
```
